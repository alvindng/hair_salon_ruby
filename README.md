# _Hair Salon_

#### _Individual Ruby Exercise for Epicodus - Ruby week 3, 7.15.16._

#### By _**Alvin Ng**_

## Description
**Hair Salon**

Website showcasing everything I learned in week 3 Ruby of Epicodus. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating an application for a hair salon. The stylists at the salon work independently, so each client will only belong to a single stylist (one stylist, many clients).

The following user stories should be completed:

As a salon owner, I want to view, add, update and delete stylists.
As a salon owner, I want to view, add, update and delete clients.
